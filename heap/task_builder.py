#Task Scheduler
#
#You are given an array of CPU tasks tasks, where tasks[i]
#is an uppercase english character from A to Z. You are also
#given an integer n.
#
#Each CPU cycle allows the completion of a single task,
#and tasks may be completed in any order.
#
#The only constraint is that identical tasks must be
#separated by at least n CPU cycles, to cooldown the CPU.
#
#Return the minimum number of CPU cycles required to
#complete all tasks.
#
#Example 1:
tasks = ["X","X","Y","Y"]
n = 2

#Output: 5
