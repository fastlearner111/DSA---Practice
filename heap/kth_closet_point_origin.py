#You are given an 2-D array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] 
#represents the coordinates of a point on an X-Y axis plane. 
#You are also given an integer k.
#
#Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
#The distance between two points is defined as the 
#Euclidean distance (sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).
#You may return the answer in any order. The answer is 
#guaranteed to be unique(except for the order in which the points are returned.)

#Example 1
points = [[0,2],[2,2]]
k = 1
#Output: [[0,2]]
