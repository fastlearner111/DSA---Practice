#124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
#A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the 
#sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once.
#Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
#
#The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
#
#Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
#
#Example 1:
#Input: root = [1,2,3]
#Output: 6
#Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
#
#Example 2:
#Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
#Output: 42
#Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
